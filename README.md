# üèõÔ∏è Crowdsourced Civic Issue Reporting & Resolution System  

This open-source platform empowers citizens to report civic issues such as potholes, broken streetlights, or garbage dumps through photos, GPS location, and voice/text descriptions. Municipal staff can view these reports on a live dashboard, powered by AI/ML to automatically categorize, prioritize, and route them to the right departments.  

Built using **React.js** for frontend and backend (API routes), with **MongoDB Atlas** as the database and **Cloudinary/AWS S3** for media storage, the system enables real-time updates, analytics, and transparent communication between citizens and municipal authorities.  

Key Features:
- Citizens can submit issues with photos, location, and notes.
- AI/ML models automatically classify and prioritize reports.
- Municipal staff see live dashboards with filters and analytics.
- Real-time notifications keep citizens informed of status changes.
- Predictive analytics highlight hotspots and resource needs.

Why It Matters:
This project promotes civic participation, transparency, and efficiency in urban issue resolution. By using AI/ML, it reduces manual workload, detects duplicate reports, and helps municipalities plan proactively. The open-source nature allows easy customization and integration with other civic or IoT systems.

Tech Stack:
- **Frontend** & **Backend API**: React.js 
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas  
- **Media Storage**: Cloudinary or AWS S3  
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js  
- **AI/ML Layer**: Python microservice or integrated API  
- **Deployment**: Vercel + MongoDB Atlas  

License:
The project uses the **MIT License**, encouraging community collaboration, contributions, and adaptation for local needs.
